Cicadas play a vital role in ecosystems, yet their populations are often concentrated in fragile habitats that require protection. Cigale.Cloud is pioneering the use of IoT and AI to map these habitats, identifying biodiversity hotspots that are crucial for conservation.

## Identifying Hidden Treasures

Using IoT sensors deployed in forests, grasslands, and urban areas, Cigale.Cloud collects real-time data on soil quality, humidity, and cicada activity. Advanced AI algorithms analyze this data, creating detailed maps of where cicadas thrive and revealing patterns that were previously invisible.

## Supporting Conservation Decision-Making

These maps empower conservationists to focus their efforts on regions that need the most attention. By visualizing areas of high ecological importance, policymakers can implement protective measures, ensuring these vital habitats remain intact for future generations.
