The rapid expansion of cities often comes at the expense of natural habitats. For cicadas, urbanization presents unique challenges, from habitat fragmentation to noise pollution. But with innovative approaches, Cigale.Cloud is helping these resilient insects adapt.

## Challenges of Urban Living

Cicadas rely on specific environmental conditions to thrive, many of which are disrupted by urban sprawl. Paved surfaces and artificial lights interfere with their natural behaviors, while noise pollution drowns out their iconic calls.

## Solutions Through Smart Urban Planning

Cigale.Cloud collaborates with urban ecologists to create green corridors and restore microhabitats within cities. By integrating IoT monitoring systems, we track the success of these efforts and refine strategies for future urban planning.
